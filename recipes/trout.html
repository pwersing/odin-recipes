    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This trout recipe is so simple, it doesn't even have a name. I just call it Trout. This is such an easy weeknight seafood dinner. It's a really nice way to cook fish, especially if you're new at cooking it.</p>    

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Â¼ cup butter</strong> 
        <li><strong>2 (8 ounce) whole trout, butterflied and deboned</strong></li>
        <li><strong>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</strong></li>
        <li><strong>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</strong></li>
        <li><strong>2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat until butter smells toasted and is golden brown, about 1 minute. Turn off heat.</p></li>
        <li><p>Line a baking sheet with a piece of aluminum foil. Place trout onto foil; open trout so skin sides are down. Drizzle each trout with about 1/2 teaspoon melted butter. Generously season with salt and black pepper.</p></li>
        <li><p>Move an oven rack to 5 or 6 inches below the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler on high heat.</p></li>
        <li><p>Broil trout until opaque and barely firm to the touch, 2 or 3 minutes. Remove from oven.</p></li>
        <li><p>Return pan of remaining melted butter over high heat; stir in lemon juice and parsley. Bring butter sauce to a boil; whisk to combine.</p></li>
        <li><p>Serve trout on plates and drizzle with butter sauce.</p></li>

    </ol>
