    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This delicious flat iron steak was created from a combination of different recipes that I read. I combined, adjusted, and finally perfected the marinade and cooking time to my taste. I'm sure you will love it as well. After all, it is perfection!</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1 (2 pound) flat iron steak</strong> 
        <li><strong>2 ½ tablespoons olive oil</strong></li>
        <li><strong>2 cloves garlic, minced</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</strong></li>
        <li><strong>¼ teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary</strong></li>
        <li><strong>½ teaspoon chopped fresh chives</strong></li>
        <li><strong>¼ cup Cabernet Sauvignon (or other dry red wine)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>½ teaspoon salt</strong></li>
        <li><strong>¾ teaspoon ground black pepper</strong></li>
        <li><strong>¼ teaspoon dry mustard powder</strong></li>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Place steak inside a large resealable bag. Stir olive oil, garlic, parsley, rosemary, chives, red wine, salt, pepper, and mustard powder together in a small bowl.</p></li>
        <li><p>Pour marinade over steak in the bag. Press out as much air as you can and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours.</p></li>
        <li><p>Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Sear and cook the steak in the hot skillet for 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium rare, or to your desired degree of doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium rare.</p></li>
        <li><p>Discard the marinade. Allow the steaks to rest for about 5 minutes before serving.</p></li>
    </ol>
